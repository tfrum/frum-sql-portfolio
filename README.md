# frum-sql-portfolio
A collection of small and large SQL projects, largely in SQLite with some Python.

## the_basics
```SQLite-Project-1```
A basic, highly-explained demonstration of CRUD and relational databasing sans Python scripting. It does bump on on the limitations of un-aided SQLite, however, which needs automation tools to be powerful unlike more complete SQL syntaxes.
To-Do:
	* actually add relational principles into it
	* increase scope on input datasets
	* introduce views in the project
	* write up results, intentions, etc, outside of code in a formatted way
