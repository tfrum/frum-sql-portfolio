# frum-sql-portfolio
A collection of small and large SQL projects, largely in SQLite with some Python.

## the_basics
```SQLite-Project-1```
A basic, highly-explained demonstration of CRUD and relational databasing sans Python scripting. I'll bump against the limitations of SQLite here.

To-Do:
	* actually add relational principles into it
	* increase scope on input datasets
	* introduce views in the project
	* write up results, intentions, etc, outside of code in a formatted way
